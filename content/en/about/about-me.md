Hello, my name is Marc-Philipp and i'm a Data Analyst at [Sedo](https://sedo.com/us/about-us/). I'm working in the Controlling department. The views on this page are entirely my own and not affiliated with my current employer.

I graduated from the university [Technische Hochschule Köln](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/homepage_26.php) (Cologne) in September 2019 as Master of Science in Market Research. In the last two semesters of my studies i decided to hack my career and spend a lot of time to teach myself programming as well as Data Science.

I wrote my master thesis about neural networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks. I used neural nets to predict the aesthetics of images and used this information to create a like predictor. The title of my thesis was: *Predicting the popularity of instagram posts with neural networks based on example of the brand Mercedes Benz*

I'm a autodidactic learner who is passionate about finding insights in data, building data products and programming. I like to learn something new everyday and grow as a person.
