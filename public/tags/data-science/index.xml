Big Data Analytics, an active research area which is concerned with analyzing large scale, fast paced and varying types of data will stay a challenging field.
You might ask yourself - how this is linked to Principal Component Analysis? This statistical analysis is able to deal with one characteristic trait of Big Data. As you may recall Big Data is primarly characterized by four Vs (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity).</description></item><item><title>Dealing with categorical data</title><link>https://example.com/blog/dealing-with-categorical-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/blog/dealing-with-categorical-data/</guid><description>Introduction In real-world datasets it is often the case that you have a mixed variable types. While Machine learning algorithmns usually can handle only numerical data, they can&amp;rsquo;t work with categorical variables. Being able to use categorical variables in modeling makes it necessary to transform those variables. This process is called Encoding and there are many different strategies for it.
There are two types of variables which can be seen as categorical variables:</description></item></channel></rss>
