I&amp;rsquo;m working in the Controlling department.
I graduated from the university Technische Hochschule KÃ¶ln (Cologne) in September 2019 as Master of Science in Market Research. In the last two semesters of my studies i decided to hack my career and spend a lot of time to teach myself programming as well as Data Science.
I wrote my master thesis about neural networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>https://example.com/about/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/about/cv/</guid><description> 2022/04/01 - v1.0.0 release 2022/02/25 - v0.9.2 release 2022/02/25 - v0.9.1 release 2022/01/31 - v0.9.0 release 2021/07/29 - v0.8.0 release 2021/07/08 - v0.7.1 release 2021/06/24 - v0.7.0 release 2021/04/15 - v0.6.2 release 2021/02/17 - v0.6.1 release 2021/02/16 - v0.6.0 release 2021/02/15 - v0.5.0 release 2021/02/12 - v0.4.0 release 2021/02/10 - v0.3.0 release 2021/02/09 - v0.2.0 release 2021/02/08 - v0.1.0 release</description></item></channel></rss>
